    <string name="answer_1_3">ooniprobe is designed to protect my privacy and therefore my use of ooniprobe cannot be detected</string>

    <string name="answer_2_3">My measurements will by default get published to OONI Explorer and will never include any personally-identifiable information</string>
    <string name="configuration_text">Certain aspects of how ooniprobe operates can be customized. Usually the default values are the best option, so only change these if you really have to.</string>
    <string name="include_ip">Should we include your IP address in results?</string>
    <string name="include_asn">Should we include your network information in the reports (note: disabling this will make it much harder for us to draw conclusions from the measurements)?</string>
    <string name="include_cc">Should we include your country name in the reports (note: disabling this will make it much harder for us to draw conclusions from the measurements)?</string>
    <string name="upload_results">Should we upload your results to the default ooni collector?</string>
